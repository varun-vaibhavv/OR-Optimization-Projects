# Linear Programming: Geometry, Duality & Sensitivity Analysis

## Overview
This project studies the foundations of linear programming through a
two-variable optimization problem, emphasizing geometric interpretation,
primal–dual formulation, and sensitivity analysis.

## Objectives
- Solve a linear programming problem graphically
- Formulate and analyze the primal and dual problems
- Verify strong duality
- Interpret shadow prices and reduced costs
- Support theory with numerical computation

## Project Structure

- `main.ipynb` – Complete analysis and visualizations  
- `geometry.py` – Graphical solution and feasible region plotting  
- `primal.py` – Primal LP formulation  
- `dual.py` – Dual problem formulation and solution  
- `sensitivity_cost.py` – Cost coefficient sensitivity  
- `sensitivity_rhs.py` – RHS sensitivity analysis  
- `interpretation.py` – Economic interpretation of results  


## Methods and Tools
