# Least Squares Curve Fitting Using SciPy

## Overview
This project studies parameter estimation using the least squares principle,
implemented through numerical methods in SciPy.

## Objectives
- Implement linear least squares using closed-form solutions
- Perform polynomial curve fitting
- Apply nonlinear curve fitting using SciPy
- Analyze residuals and interpret goodness of fit

## Methods and Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

## Contents
- `main.ipynb`: Least squares models, curve fitting, and residual analysis
- Supporting Python modules for computation and plotting

## Status
In Progress

## Expected Completion
Early February 2026

## Notes
The project emphasizes numerical computation and interpretation rather than
advanced nonlinear optimization theory.
