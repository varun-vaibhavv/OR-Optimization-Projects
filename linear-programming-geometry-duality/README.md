# Linear Programming: Geometry, Duality & Sensitivity

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of Optimization and
Operational Research using a single linear programming problem.

## Concepts Covered
- Graphical solution of LPP
- Primal–dual formulation
- Strong duality theorem
- Shadow prices and reduced costs
- Sensitivity analysis

## Tools
Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, PuLP

## How to Run
1. Open `main.ipynb`
2. Run cells sequentially

## Key Results
- Optimal solution: (x1, x2) = (2, 3)
- Optimal value: Z = 21
- Dual value equals primal value
- Shadow prices interpreted economically

## Motivation
This project was done as preparation for research in Optimization
and Operational Research.
