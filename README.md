# Optimization and Operations Research Projects

This repository contains a collection of academic projects developed as part
of my training in Optimization and Operations Research.

The projects emphasize:
- Mathematical formulation
- Theoretical understanding
- Correct interpretation of results
- Computational verification using Python

Each project is organized in a separate folder with its own documentation.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Linear Programming: Geometry, Duality & Sensitivity Analysis
Study of linear programming through graphical solutions, primal–dual
formulation, strong duality, and sensitivity analysis, supported by numerical
computation.

**Status:** Completed  
**Tools:** Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, PuLP

### 2. Transportation & Assignment Problems
Exploration of algorithmic and structured linear programming problems,
including network-based optimization models.

**Status:** Completed  
**Tools:** Python, PuLP,NumPy, Matplotlib

---

### 3. Least Squares Curve Fitting
Numerical study of parameter estimation using the least squares principle,
including linear, polynomial, and nonlinear curve fitting, with residual
analysis.

**Status:** Completed
**Tools:** Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

### 4. Integer Linear Programming for Scheduling and Logistics
Coursework-aligned project focusing on integer linear programming models,
branch-and-bound methods, and applications to scheduling and logistics.

**Status:** In Progress (expected completion: early February 2026)
**Tools:** Python, PuLP, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Notes
- Each folder contains a dedicated `README.md` with project-specific details.
- Completed projects are fully reproducible and include interpretation of results.
- In-progress projects will be updated as development proceeds.
